# AutoResponder.py
#
# Description:
#    Demonstrates how to set up a list of commands/text that get sent to the
#    remote as soon as a corresponding "trigger" string/text is detected from
#    the remote system.
#    Once launched, this script will run indefinitely until the session is
#    disconnected or the application is closed.  To stop the script, choose
#    "Cancel" from SecureCRT's main "Script" menu.
#
# Demonstrates:
# - How to use the Session.Connected property to determine if the current
#    tab has an active connection.
# - How to wait for one of multiple string values to appear, and detect
#    which one was found using the Screen.WaitForStrings method.
