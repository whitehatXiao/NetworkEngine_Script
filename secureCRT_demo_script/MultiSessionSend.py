# MultiSessionSend.py
#
# Description:
#	 Reads in sessions from a file (one session per line) and
#	 connects to each one (one at a time) and sends a series of
#	 commands to the remote, then disconnects from the session
#	 and moves on to the next session.
#
#	 By default, the file containing the sessions is expected to be named
#	 "SessionList.txt", and should be located in the current user's home
#	 directory.  Each line of the file is expected to contain the
#	 path to the session as it appears within the Connect dialog (excluding
#	 the leading "Sessions/" component.  Here is an example file contents:
#
#		 redhat
#		 redhat8
#		 192.168.0.123
#		 192.168.0.131
#		 Redhat Sessions\RedHat - XTerm
#
#	 For the sake of simplicity, this example assumes that all
#	 sessions we're connecting to are using the SSH1 and SSH2
#	 protocols, with usernames and passwords saved encrypted
#	 as part of the session configuration so that we don't need
#	 to worry about authentication within this script.
